## [Tutorial: Making and assessing FAIR biomedical data](https://maastrichtu-ids.github.io/FAIRnessEvaluationTutorial/) ##

This tutorial was presented in [Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) 2022 in NICE](https://mie2022.org/). This tutorial targets at researchers, developers, students, data managers, data stewards, and anyone who is interested in research data management, FAIR guiding principles, making their digital resources FAIR, FAIRness assessment and improvement, and building biomedical domain-specific FAIRness evaluation tests for the community.

### Abstract 
This tutorial sheds light on the intent of the FAIR principles, outline approaches to create biomedical data, and guide participants to automatically assess the FAIRness of digital resources. 

This tutorial provides clear instruction to participants on 
- what FAIR is really about
- what steps are needed to create FAIR biomedical/health data
- how to assess the FAIRness of online digital resources, and 
- how to create and use domain-specific FAIRness tests. 

Participants will be able to explain the differences between automatic FAIRness assessment tools, correctly interpret their outputs, and devise strategies to address identified shortcomings. Participants will discuss the limitations of current metric collections and explore the development of a domain-specific (e.g., rare disease) FAIR metric test as a FAIR API using a Python library. Finally, participants will execute a new FAIRness assessment using these custom tests.
